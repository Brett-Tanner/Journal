## April 1st

- [x] Fix parents not being unable to unregister for activities if it dropped them below their previous invoice amount

### Materials

- Add lesson search
  - [x] Write system spec
  - [x] Add views
  - [x] Add controller
  - [x] Figure out how to integrate the DA short levels (mostly just ele) into the search
    - Either duplicate the Ele key somehow
    - Or when mapping the select options, map the integer as the value rather than the downcased key
  - Remove the need for turbo-target top on status toggles
    - [x] refactor 'after_update_url' to be on lesson

## April 2nd

### Materials

- Add lesson search
  - Remove the need for turbo-target top on status toggles
    - [] submit a hidden 'index' boolean in the toggles that redirects to the index after updating
- [] Add start/quit date/birthday dates to student
  - [] Also search by them
  - [] And refactor the search controller to have the searcahble params in constants

#### Lessons

- Proposed change rework
  - Either migrate the lang goals and interesting fact cols to proposed changes, along with type, and somehow dynamically inherit from the types
  - Or, just store in the same table and have a boolean marking them proposal or not/an enum for their status
  - [] Proposed changes need to generate a PDF as well
  - [] Need to be able to compare proposed change and current version side by side

#### Parent accounts

- [] Add extra emails field
  - [] Can login in with any email
  - [] They can add emails but not delete
- Should be able to exchange messages with their child's school; teachers, SM and org admin
- [] Ensure new user signups can only be parents
  - [] And also give a link to sign up per-org
  - probably super the Devise controller

### Event Site

- [] IP lock SM accounts

### API

Request will contain an array of event names they want stats for (determined in sheets by the close dates in sheets for those events) and an API key.

Needs to return these values for each event at each school which is ongoing or closed less than a month ago, as a hash keyed by event name and school id.

#### Seasonal

- Number of internal + reservation
- Number of external
- Internal + res revenue
- External revenue
- Goal

#### Parties

- Total revenue
- Goal

##### Testing

- Write tests for Invoice#calc_cost to prepare for the rewrite
  - Summary
    - [] Test that event options are removed from blank invoices
      - They're currently shown, and the registration remains on the invoice, but not charged for
      - Did not end up doing this because the logic is too entangled
      - Obvious solution is to mark them for destruction in orphan option check, but that's also used with hashes, not just models
      - So can't call #mark_for_destruction, #destroy or set the \_destroy flag
  - [] PDF creation (or at least that one is created)
- Rewrite Invoice#calc_cost as separate classes for cost calculation, summary generation and PDF creation
  - Can test it separately with unit tests till ready, then swap it in when done
- [] Refactor request specs to use rails path helpers
- [] Test emails with [email_spec](https://github.com/email-spec/email-spec) gem
- [] Create `rails predeploy` task to run all the tests and brakeman prior to deployments

#### Future Plans

- [] Add a table showing a summary of inquiries per month and type, as well as total per month [like this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fcCN4togDFfhgDeuver5Ts-Javrq_s-RI0b_qRcJc3k/edit#gid=1456240236)
- [] Allow for varying price list courses by automatically determining max/intervals in invoice calc
- [] Overwrite the sign in path properly as well
  - Can use `stored__location_for` to redirect to originally requested page
- [] Uncomment `config.force_ssl` in production, we're already redirecting to HTTPS and the other stuff is good
- [] Investigate what happens if you upload a new asset with the same key as an existing one
- [] When importing the historical setsu/inquiries, try insert/upsert_all with record_timestamps: false to set our own created at
- [] In August 2022, RDS certificate [expires](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating). Will need to rotate to avoid connectivity issues.
- [] Move control of the domain from Onamae to Cloudflare
- Platform Upgrades
  - TEST ALL ON STAGING FIRST
  - [] Bump AWS platform version
    - [] And enable YJIT
  - [] Try bumping Ruby version to latest stable (can maybe install manually with a pre-deploy hook)
- [] Add button to generate photo service armband PDF for parties
  - Printable template with kids' names and a color which shows their photo status

##### ActiveRecord

- Look into [delegated types](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/DelegatedType.html)
  - [] especially for splitting the mess of user logic into more manageable chunks
- Maybe use [#store](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Store.html) on models with JSON, seems to give a nicer API
  - [] price lists
  - [] surveys
  - [] maybe email preferences
- Can use has_one on a has_many to single out a specific important record
  - [] Next event
  - [] Active invoice
- Rather than manually setting `_destroy`, use `#mark_for_destruction`
  - [] Will be used by invoice calculations, maybe in the confirm controller too?
- You can define methods on associations either by nesting them within a block for that association or defining a class method on the model like `self.my_method`
  - Lets me pass parameters to an operation on an association
  - But I think this is basically just scopes no?
  - Apparently can define a scope on children like `scope :event_invoices, ->(name) { where(event_name: name) }`
- More specific to what I've needed before, you can pass params to scopes by just putting brackets with the params after the '->'
  - Can also put these in modules for re-use, could be handy for stuff like dates that are on everything
  - [] Definitely useful somewhere in the Charts/Stats section of the site
- validates_acceptance_of creates a virtual attribute which must be true for the record to be saved
  - [] add to User for backend validation of privacy policy
- You can chain a list of validations on a single column, like `validates presence: true, uniqueness: true ... etc.`
- Use SQL strings, or maybe the active_record_import gem to update children

##### Optimisation

- [] Nest the confirm_invoice view inside the new route so it's confirm_new_invoice_path

```
resources :invoices do
  new do
    post :confirm
  end
end
```

- [] Similarly, I could do school filtering by nesting those resources inside the school resource.
- [] Use #fetch and #dig in the controller rather than conditionals about the existence of a param, since they can have a default value if not found
- See if the occasional memory problems are actually something more like [this](https://www.engineyard.com/blog/thats-not-a-memory-leak-its-bloat/)
  - [] Also loading all the TimeSlots and Options from the start when calculating Invoice costs
  - [] Also maybe Rack::Bug, or a newer version of something similar since it was last updated in 2015
- Simplify/modularize invoice code
  - [] Split out PDF functionality
  - [] Preload all the stuff I need for calc_cost at the start and pass it explicitly
  - [] Create columns for each type of cost?
- [] use read/write_attribute or bracked notation in my custom getters/setters
  - Not sure what I'm using now, but probably not those
- [] Use AWS Cloudfront to serve images?
- [] Can probably speed up queries for ChartController with pluck
- [] If indexing FK columns which can be null, exclude null from the index

##### Views

- [] Extract conditonal info display into its own partial
  - Already done for the child one, just make more general for parents & move to shared folder
- [] Remember you can use partials in turbo-stream responses, I'm sure there's some stuff to clean up there
- [] Move set_shared_vars in the mailer to a before_action, is fine to apply to all mailers I think
- [] Use @layer to section off old BS styles so I can switch to tailwind
  - But both tailwind and BS using !important liberally might make that problematic
- [] Use `current_page` helpers in partials to conditionally render stuff like diff school selection on event partial
- [] Add a photo_for helper to encapsulate nil checks for associated images and return empty string if missing
- [] Check for missing translations with `i18n-tasks`
- [] Remove locale param from number_to_currency calls, shouldn't need it
- [] number_to_phone_number exists
- [] there's also a number_to_percentage helper, but may be more verbose than what I'm doing now
- [] Change the current event#show to be Invoice#new, since that's what it really is
  - [] Rework the current add_slot partials into a container, morning and afternoon
    - They can likely use fieldsets (with a form attribute matching the invoice form's id) to be submitted with the form directly
    - reduces the JS I need on that page [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset)
- [] If you wanna show fallback content (like on the invoice index) use `render 'partial' || 'fallback text/content'`
- [] Extract form error messages into a shared partial
- [] Potentially also extract fields shared between multiple models into a partial (e.g. names for kids/parents)
  - Or just partials for each type of form group? As a fieldset
- [] Apparently there are undocumented ControllerHelper methods I can use to generate the ID for for main elements
- [] Use time_tag helper when outputting date or time, generates a `time` element which apparently is a thing
- [] Use number_to_human_size when I add the blob index etc.

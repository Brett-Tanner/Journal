  - Ended up creating the blob independently then assigning it with = rather than attach to avoid saves

- [x] consider using a tempfile for images uploaded just for PDF creation instead of ActiveStorage
  - Especially since AS way seems to not be working right now
  - Did come up with a way of doing this, but regenerating pdfs would be an issue
  - As images would only be stored in PDF
  - Went back to has_one_attached, but the image was not available to add to the PDF before saving
  - So eventually settled for queueing a job to generate the PDF after create or update in LessonsController
  - Couldn't use a model callback as it triggered the callback recursively

## February 19th

## [Materials](https://github.com/Brett-Tanner/materials)

- [x] Hide areas/prefectures that are empty on main site school search

  - [x] Try out using Docker for development as well
    - Dismissed as having multiple Dockerfiles/compose.ymls is annoying and Bun tailwind updates didn't work
  - [x] Try and get an Alpine Docker image running
    - Gave up after multiple rounds of failing to install Poppler-related dependencies. Damn PDFs.
- Figure out the actual process of deployment
  - [x] Try just pushing the Docker image to Elastic Beanstalk
    - Didn't work, Elastic Beanstalk can't read the Ruby version inside ${} so hardcoded it
    - Fixed some other small things and got it to 'succeed', but in actuality it timed out and couldn't be interacted with
    - May have been related to me starting a new env while the old one was terminating, and RDS being decoupled on that old one

## February 21st

- [x] Fix Jayson's ACM cert
  - Seems you need to add the CNAME records for subdomains to Route 53, not onamae

#### Deployment

- [x] Configure active record for production
- [x] Configure active storage for production
- [x] Confirm the container can access ENV variables set in EB console
- [x] Add .ebignore
- [x] Resolve some early deploy errors like ${} interpolation not working & docker-compose.yml suddenly reappearing
- [x] Get back to the old problem of deployment timing out
  - Seems EB tries to delete the old container's image while it's still running
  - I think that might be fine though, seems it's maybe intended to fail for images in use?
  - Saw some SO responses suggesting immutable deployments (creating a new instance and replacing the old if successful) might resolve the issue
    - Didn't do the trick on its own, still timing out. But might revisit later if other issues come up
  - Possible the EC2 instance doesn't have enough memory to build the image? Only 500MB and finished image is ~630MB
- [x] Successfully pull & build image manually, then run it by manually passing all env variables
  - Try enabling log streaming to track deploy progress as it happens
- [x] One person seems to have solved slow deploys by just deploying their Dockerfile, which pulls the built image from dockerhub
  - Same timeout error as before
  - [x] Another variant is to just directly upload Dockerrun.aws.json and pull the built image from DockerHub
    - Same issue still
- [x] After just leaving it running for ages, try upgrading the instance class for more memory
  - Didn't work, not ruling memory out as an issue yet though
- When I leave it for ages I get 'The following resource(s) failed to create: [AWSEBInstanceLaunchWaitCondition]', but all the SO answers/AWS guidance for that talks about not having an internet gateway on your VPC, which I do. So pretty sure I need to figure out why it's timing out instead.

## February 22nd

### Seasonal Site

- [x] Line graph of daily inquiries (per month/school/area)
- [x] Average for all schools on the all schools one

### Materials Site

- Memory is an issue on the smallest instance, the container seems to sit around 600MB so we'll need at least 1GB of RAM

- [x] Successful deploy!

  - Didn't work
- [x] Sort out this msgpack issue that's causing bootsnap to fail (but only in the docker image)
  - Seems to appear when I remove the interpolation from the Bun version???????? Wtf??????
  - Think it's because the step after is the one with the issue, so changing a prior step causes it to be rebuilt rather than pulled from cache
  - Maybe because I locked all the gem versions
  - [x] `--no-cache` seemed to solve it, then wasn't needed after. Also bookmarked some more.
